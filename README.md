TinyWorlds is a minimal autoregressive world model built on Google Deepmind's [Genie Architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15391).

World models can't use action-less internet video to scale like [VEO3](https://deepmind.google/models/veo/). Deepmind's [Genie](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/) solves this by inferring the actions between frames using **no prior action data**.

TinyWorlds is meant to help people understand the clever autoregressive, unsupervised method Deepmind likely used to achieve **scalable world models**.

# Overview

### Why World Models?

*To shape the world, generate it*

A [world model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10122) is a function mapping the current state of an environment to the next state of an environment.

To predict the next environment state accurately, this function must compress all information in the world into a set of laws. 

So the world model **captures all the inherent structure and emergent phenomena of the world.** 

All of deep learning, and all of intelligence, is [trying to compress the universe into a model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4360). A model that can predict important aspects of the next state of the universe, by learning heuristics about how it operates.

Our universe can also be thought of as a world model. It is a map from state to state executing every moment by following a set of laws. Humans experience the many layers of emergent behavior over these foundational laws.

As of 2025, video-based world models have been practically applied as:

1. cortexes to give physical world understanding to robots
2. simulators for models to interact with physics fully-online
3. experiences with new structures of reality for humans to interact with

But humans are only at the very beginning of modeling our own worlds.

TinyWorlds is built to help you to understand world modeling better, and to [learn by contributing](#contributing). 

### Architecture Overview
![tinyworldsarch](/assets/tinyworldsarchv3.png)

TinyWorlds is an autoregressive transformer over discrete tokens, so we can also use SOTA LLM techniques to improve our world model. 

Why discrete tokens? Discretization makes our dynamics prediction problem much easier, because instead of predicting an image a near-infinite continuous space, it need only select one of the ~1000 tokens in our vocabulary (aka codebook).

TinyWorlds consists of three modules:

**Video Tokenizer:** This tokenizer reconstructs a sequence of video with a small discrete bottleneck (our video tokens) in the middle. **This layer  compresses the important information from video to tokens.**

**Action Tokenizer:** This tokenizer **infers the discrete action token between two frames**. It trains by reconstructing the next frame using the previous frame and a discrete action token that sees the next frame.

**Dynamics Model:** Given past action and frame tokens, this predicts our next frame tokens. **This should capture the physics of our tiny video game worlds.**

# Building Blocks

### Space-Time Transformer
![stt](/assets/spacetimetransformer.png)

[Space-Time Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.02908) (STT) is a transformer for video. Each STT block contains a spatial attention layer, a temporal attention layer, and a FeedForward Network (FFN). For a brush up on self-attention, see Karpathy's [GPT From Scratch Video](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=tvfcBnGHBbEiS70v&t=3748)

In the spatial layer, each token attends to all other tokens in the same frame. In the temporal layer, each token attends to tokens in the same position but previous timesteps.

The FFN is a multi-layer perceptron on each embedding vector. Inspired by divine benevolence, I used [SwiGLU](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05202) for the FFN. SwiGLU adds a Gated Linear Unit (GLU) to [Swish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swish_function), and is computed as 

$x_t = W_3[\sigma(W_1x + b1) * W_2x + b2] + b3$ (see SwiGLU diagram for clarity)


For regular STT, I used [Root Mean Squared Normalization (RMSNorm)](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.modules.normalization.RMSNorm.html) as the normalizer, which is less sensitive to extreme outliers than 0-variance norm. In RMS, we divide our input by 

$\sqrt(\epsilon + x / \sum x^2)$. 

For STT conditioned on actions, I used [Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07871). FiLM passes actions for each timestep through an FFN to transform each action latent into Gamma ($\gamma$) and Beta ($\beta$) vectors. Our norm is then 

$(x - \mu) / \sigma * (1 + \gamma) + \beta$

### Variational Autoencoder

*\*VAEs are complex, but below is an overview with many details omitted*

[Variational Autoencoders]((https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02691)) (VAEs) are defined by:
1. An encoder network to parameterize the approximate posterior distribution $q(z | x)$ of latent variables $z$ given data $x$
3. A decoder network to parameterize the likelihood $p(x | z)$ over input data x given latent z

VAEs maximize $log(p(x | z))$, the likelihood the decoder exactly reconstructs the input x given latent z from the encoder. 

The important takeaway is that $z$ is low dimensional, so for reconstruction, it will compress all the important information from $x$.

### Finite Scalar Quantization 

![fsq](/assets/finitescalarquantizer.png)

Since we want a set of discrete tokens, we quantize continous $z$ to one of a finite set of possible $z$.

If vectors are points in high dimensional space, [Finite Scalar Quantization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15505) (FSQ) is a quantization method that divides space into hypercubes, and the hypercube a vector falls into becomes its quantized representation.

Concretely, we quantize a vector in FSQ by:

1. tanh(x) which bounds to [-1,1]
2. scale/shift to [0, L]
3. round to the nearest integer (quantization step)
4. scale/shift back to [-1,1]

The token vocabulary has size ${L^{D}}$ where $L$ is bins per dimension and $D$ is the dimensionality of the hypercube. With 3 dimensions and 2 levels per dimension, we'd have 8 regions in the cube and size 8 token vocabulary. 

FSQ VAEs let us learn structured hypercubes to use as our token vocabularies that encode information about the input. In our context, maybe one of these hypercubes represents moving left, another jumping, another crouching, et cetera.

To allow gradients to flow to the encoder (since quantization is non-differentiable), we pass the post-quantization gradients directly to the pre-quantization layer. 

Precisely, the decoder takes as input $z + stopgrad(z_q - z)$ where stopgrad is, in pytorch, `.detach()`. The decoder only uses $z_q$ (since $z - z = 0$), but the gradient is taken only on $z$.

# Architecture

### Video Tokenizer

![videotokenizer](/assets/videotokenizer.png)

The video tokenizer is an FSQ VAE that compresses videos into discrete tokens. It reduces the dimensionality of dynamics while enabling high quality video generation.

It converts patches to embeddings with pixel-mixing 2D Convolutions.

It then uses an STTransformer over the embeddings to produce quantized tokens. 

Each video token contains information about both its own patch and other patches in the same location or timestep. 

Finally, it decodes the video tokens into a reconstructed image.


### Action Tokenizer

![actiontokenizer](/assets/actiontokenizer.png)

The Action Tokenizer is also an FSQ VAE, and is the key to scalability. It allows us to train without action labels by learning to infer actions between two frames. We then condition the dynamics on these actions.

The encoder takes in a sequence of frames and outputs action tokens between the frames.

The decoder takes in all previous frames $(x_1...x_t-1)$ and quantized action latent vectors $(a_1...a_t-1)$ as input and predicts the next frames $(x_2...x_t)$.

Action tokens should learn to encode the most meaningful change between the past and current frame, which should correspond to some high-level action.

In practice, the action decoder tries to ignore actions and infer purely from images. To counteract this, 
1. we mask most frames except the first, so the decoder must learn to use the string of actions as signal for reconstruction
2. we encourage batch-wise variance in the encoder through an auxiliary loss

At inference time, we map each key to one of the action tokens that conditions the dynamics for the user to influence video generation.

### Dynamics Model
![dynamicsmodel](/assets/dynamicsmodel.png)

At timestep $t$, the dynamics model should take in tokenized video tokens $z_{1..t - 1}$ and action tokens $a_{_1..t - 1}$ and predict next frame tokens $z_{t}$.

In practice, we train dynamics like [MaskGIT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.04200) and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805).

We mask a subset of tokens and train our model to predict the masked tokens, conditioned on all current and previous frame and action tokens.

To infer dynamics at a given step, we first append a fully masked frame to our context sequence. Then, for T steps we:
1. Predict logits at each masked position
2. Compute token probabilities with softmax
3. Sample the k most likely tokens out of the still unmasked positions
4. Place them into the context tensor, removing corresponding mask tokens
5. Repeat

I chose an exponential schedule for k (first step samples ~1 token, then ~2, then ~5, then ~20, then ~50, etc)

### TinyWorlds Inference

Given initial context frames from the training distribution, we first tokenize them.

We then run the following loop:
1. The player specifies one of the n_actions action tokens to use by choosing integer in $[0, |A|]$
2. Condition the dynamics model with context window c on the video tokens t-c...t and action tokens t-c..t and run dynamics inference 
3. Detokenize the predicted video tokens into a new video frame for the user

We repeat this process autoregressively over the time dimension as actions are passed to the model, tokens are predicted by the dynamics model, we detokenize them into frames to display to the user.

This process also lets us predict multiple future frames at once (bounded by memory and the training distribution), which can improve inference quality.

### Data

![datasets](/assets/datasets_stylized.png)

The data is processed and downsampled from gameplay `.mp4s` into `.h5` files.

### Training/Inference Acceleration

TinyWorlds supports the following torch features to accelerate training and/or inference:
1. **Torch compile**, which allows us to use faster CUDA kernels for certain pre-optimized operations like attention and matmuls
2. **Distributed data parallel (DDP)**, which allows us to train using multiple gpus by using same model different data per-gpu
3. **Automatic mixed precision (AMP)**, which scales certain ops from FP32 to BF16 based on the current nodes used floating point range
4. **TF32 training**, which lets us use NVIDIA TensorFloat32 for tensor-core-optimized matmuls and convolutions
